              <h3> Education</h3>
              <p>I have graduated with a BSc Computer Science degree from the University of Leicester. 
                  During our course we were introduced to many programming langauges such as JavaScript,HTML,CSS and Python. We were given many opportunties to practice using these programming languages during our assignments and team projects.
                  During my free time, I have tried completing courses on codeacademy.com to improve my knowledge in these languages. I have also took online  bootcamp courses which  advanced my knowlegde JavaScript, Python, React and web development.</p>

            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>I have coding experience in JavaScript,Python,CSS,HTML, React and Swift</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "service">
            <h3>Relevant Experience</h3>
            <p class ="title"><strong>Consultant</strong> </p>
            <p>Completed a virtual consultancy challenege which was offered by our university.
            During this experience, I was required to work closely with the company Meet and Engage as a consultant. We worked in a team of 3, and were required to give recommendations to increase the onboarding experience
            .I took the role as a team lead within our group, and was responsible for holding meetings with the client. As well as making sure our team was meeting all the targets within the given time frame.
            <p class = "title"> <strong>Final year project</strong></p>
            <p> Developed an iOS app in swift. Which allowed users to make their own family trees and search and contact others users on the database.
                Swift was not taught at university, I decided to take this opportunty to self teach myself a new language and challenge myself further.

    <p>
        I love to learn new things and challenge myself. Coding and how websites work has always fascinated me, hence my choice for a degree in Computer Science. My degree has provided me with analytical and problem solving skills, and my volunteering experience has provided me with skills such as strong communication and the ability to remain calm whilst dealing with challenging people. My degree also further confirmed my interest for technology, which has lead me to the path of  taking many online courses on different aspects of sofrware development.

        I have volunteered at alzheimers society where I worked as a fund raiser, I managed to raise Â£200, due to team work and good communication skills whilst dealing with the general public. During my free time, I enjoy being active and go on long walks. I try to meet my daily target od 15,000 steps a day to keep me fit and refreshed.
